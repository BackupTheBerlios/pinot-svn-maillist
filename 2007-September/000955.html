+    &quot;--enable-threadsafe --enable-threads-override-locks&quot; to configure.
+
+  * If you have built Pinot from source, make sure you have done a &quot;make install&quot;.
+    Pinot will fail to start if it can't find stuff it needs, its icon for
+    instance.
+
+  * If &quot;make install&quot; fails with an error about Categories in pinot.desktop
+    and you have desktop-file-utils 0.11, either downgrade to 0.10 or upgrade
+    to 0.12 if possible, or edit the top-level Makefile and replace the line

+    and run &quot;make install&quot; again.
+
+  * In stored queries, the directory filter doesn't work as expected if the
+    directory name starts with a non alpha-numeric character. This has been
+    fixed in Xapian 0.9.8.
+
+  * On FreeBSD, threading issues may cause the daemon to crash unexpectedly.

-    '/usr/share/libtextcat/LM/danish.lm'&quot; or similar in the output of
-    pinot-index, or in one of the logs in ~/.pinot, this means the language
-    models required by libtextcat are not in the expected location. You
-    should edit the file /etc/pinot/textcat_conf.txt and modify the paths to
-    the language models. By default, they are looked for under the directory
-    /usr/share/libtextcat/
