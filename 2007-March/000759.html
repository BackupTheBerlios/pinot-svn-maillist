-3. Using the Google API
+3. Available engines 
 
 
+  One of the main functionalities of Pinot is metasearch. This lets you query
+  a variety of sources, including Web-based search engines. By default, the
+  list of available engines is hidden and defaults to internal indexes (see
+  section &quot;4. Indexes&quot;). To show the list of engines, click on the Show All
+  Search Engines button, next to the Query field immediately below the menu
+  bar. Click on the same button again to hide the list.
+
+  Any number of engine or engine group may be selected at any one time.
+  Multi-selection is done like in any other application. All queries are always
+  run against the list of currently selected engines.
+
+  Starting with v0.42, Pinot supports both Sherlock and OpenSearch Description
+  plugins. They are installed in $PREFIX/share/pinot/engines/, where PREFIX
+  is usually /usr. Additional engines can be installed in that directory or
+  in ~/.pinot/engines. Note this directory is not created automatically.
+
+  Sherlock is what Firefox and the Mozilla suite use. Chances are that somebody
+  wrote a plugin for the engine you are interested in. MyCroft at
+  <A HREF="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/">http://mycroft.mozdev.org/</A> has got plenty of plugins. Beware that a lot are
+  out of date and will require some changes. Use pinot-search on the
+  command-line to run a quick check on a plugin, eg
+  $ pinot-search sherlock /usr/share/pinot/engines/Bozo.src &quot;clowns&quot;
+
+  Plugins are categorized by channels. For Sherlock plugins, the routeType
+  element under SEARCH specifies the name of the channel the plugin belongs to.
+
+  As for OpenSearch, A9.com has an extensive list at
+  <A HREF="http://a9.com/-/search/moreColumns.jsp.">http://a9.com/-/search/moreColumns.jsp.</A> A Description file is not available
+  for all engines though...
+  Pinot should work with OpenSearch Description 1.0 and 1.1 (draft 2) plugins.
+  One thing to keep in mind is that because Description doesn't describe how
+  to parse the results page returned by the search engine, Pinot assumes that
+  the engine will return results formatted according to the OpenSearch Response
+  standard.
+  In practice, this means that plugins that don't stick to the following rules
+  will be ignored or won't show any result :
+    * For Description 1.1 plugins, the type attribute on the Url field must be
+      set to &quot;application/atom+xml&quot; or &quot;application/rss+xml&quot; (default).
+      &quot;text/html&quot; will be rejected.
+    * The search engine's results page content type must be some form of XML,
+      otherwise Pinot won't attempt parsing it. 
+  Pinot differs from the Description spec in that it interprets the Tags field
+  as a channel name. The standard defines Tags as a &quot;space-delimited set of
+  words that are used as keywords to identify and categorize this search
+  content&quot;.
+
   If the version of Pinot you are using was built with support for the Google
-  SOAP API, a &quot;Google API&quot; engine will appear in pinot's engines list. To query
-  this engine, you need to obtain a key from Google.
-
-  Go to <A HREF="http://api.google.com/">http://api.google.com/</A> and create an account. You will then receive
-  your Google API key by email. Start pinot and enter the key in the corresponding
+  SOAP API, a &quot;Google API&quot; engine will appear in the group The Web. To query
+  this engine, create an account at <A HREF="http://api.google.com/.">http://api.google.com/.</A> You will then
+  receive a Google API key by email. Enter this key in the corresponding
   field in the General tab of the Preferences box.
 
 
-4. Automatic indexing and monitoring
+4. Indexes
 
 
+  Pinot has two internal indexes. My Documents is populated by the D-Bus
+  service and contains documents found on your computer. My Web Pages is
+  populated by the UI whenever you :
+    * import an external document, using the Index, Import URL menu
+    * index results returned by Web engines, using the Results, Index menu
+      or through a Stored Query
+  Both index may have any of the file types listed in section &quot;8. File formats&quot;.
+
+  Indexes built by any other Xapian-based tools can be added to Pinot. To add
+  an external index, click the + button at the bottom of the engines list.
+  It can either be local, in which case you will have to select the directory
+  where it is found, or served from a remote machine by xapian-tcpsrv. See
+  the manual page for xapian-tcpsrv(1).
+
+  All indexes are grouped together under the channel Current User in the
+  engines list.
+
+
+5. Indexing and monitoring
+
+
   Pinot can automatically index :
-    * directories and their contents. Monitoring for changes is optional.
-    * mbox mail accounts. Monitoring is always enabled.
-  Both are configured with the Indexing tab in the Preferences box and are
+    * mbox mail accounts. Monitoring for changes is always enabled.
+    * directories. Their contents are crawled. Monitoring is optional.
+  Both are configured under the Indexing tab of the Preferences box and are
   handled by the D-Bus service.
-  If you want to exclude specific files or directories from indexing, use
-  patterns as described in section &quot;8. File formats&quot;.
-  See section &quot;10. D-Bus service&quot;.
 
+  All files and directories with a name that starts with a dot, eg &quot;.gaim&quot;,
+  are skipped and their content is not indexed. If you want to exclude any
+  other specific files or directories from indexing, use patterns as described
+  in section &quot;9. File patterns&quot;.
 
-5. Search strategy
+  Mbox files held in a dot-directory should be added to the mail boxes list
+  in Preferences. Others found during a directory crawl will be fully indexed
+  but not monitored for changes.
 
+  While Pinot is not currently able to get to and index application-specific
+  data held in dot-directories, it can index common file formats as listed
+  in section &quot;8. File formats&quot;.
+  If you would like to index your GAIM chat logs, which are plain HTML files,
+  symlink ~/.gaim/logs to one of the directories configured in Preferences.
 
+
+6. Search strategy
+
+
   When querying an index, Pinot adopts a multi-stepped search strategy that
   first attempts to find the documents that best match the query. If a given
   step doesn't return results, the next step alters the query slightly before
