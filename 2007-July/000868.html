 5. Indexing and monitoring
 
 
-  Pinot can automatically index :
-    * mbox mail accounts. Monitoring for changes is always enabled.
-    * directories. Their contents are crawled. Monitoring is optional.
-  Both are configured under the Indexing tab of the Preferences box and are
-  handled by the D-Bus service.
+  Pinot can index any directory configured under the Indexing tab of the
+  Preferences box. Monitoring is optional and should be disabled for the
+  directories whose contents seldom change, eg /usr/share/doc.
+  Indexing and monitoring of directories is handled by the D-Bus service.
 
-  All files and directories with a name that starts with a dot, eg &quot;.gaim&quot;,
-  are skipped and their content is not indexed. If you want to exclude any
-  other specific files or directories from indexing, use patterns as described
-  in section &quot;9. File patterns&quot;.
-
-  Mbox files held in a dot-directory should be added to the mail boxes list
-  in Preferences. Others found during a directory crawl will be fully indexed
-  but not monitored for changes.
-
   While Pinot is not currently able to get to and index application-specific
   data held in dot-directories, it can index common file formats as listed
   in section &quot;8. File formats&quot;.
-  If you would like to index your GAIM chat logs, which are plain HTML files,
-  symlink ~/.gaim/logs to one of the directories configured in Preferences.
 
+  All files and directories with a name that starts with a dot, eg &quot;.gaim&quot;,
+  are skipped and their content is not indexed. If you wish to include the
+  contents of some dot-directories, create a symlink to a directory that is
+  configured in Preferences. For instance, if your home directory is
+  configured for indexing, create a symlink from &quot;~/.gaim/logs&quot; to

 9. File patterns

   glob(3) patterns. These patterns are configured in the Indexing tab of the
