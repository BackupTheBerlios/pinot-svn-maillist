-Pinot is a metasearch tool for the Free Desktop. It acts as a front-end

-Name			Location			Version used
-----			--------			------------
 
+1. What is Pinot
+
+
+  Pinot is :
+    * a D-Bus service that crawls, indexes and monitors your documents
+      (&quot;pinot-dbus-daemon&quot;)
+    * a GTK-based user interface that enables to query the index built by the
+      service or your favourite Web engine, and display and analyze the
+      results (&quot;pinot&quot;)
+    * other command-line tools
+  It was developed and tested on GNU/Linux and should work on other Unix-like
+  systems.
+
+
+2. Upgrading from previous versions
+
+
+  * from 0.50 or older to 0.60
+  The &quot;My Documents&quot; index was renamed &quot;My Web Pages&quot;. A new index, appropriately
+  named &quot;My Documents&quot; ;-), includes all local files including mbox files and is
+  populated by the new D-Bus service.
+  If you used the Import facility to index specific directories on your system,
+  it is recommended you manually unindex the corresponding documents from the
+  &quot;My Web Pages&quot; index, and configure these directories to be automatically
+  indexed by the D-Bus service (see section &quot;4. Automatic indexing and monitoring&quot;).
+  The &quot;My EMail&quot; index was dropped. Email messages will now appear in your
+  &quot;My Documents&quot; index.
+
+
+3. Using the Google API
+
+
+  If the version of Pinot you are using was built with support for the Google
+  SOAP API, a &quot;Google API&quot; engine will appear in pinot's engines list. To query
+  this engine, you need to obtain a key from Google.
+  Go to <A HREF="http://api.google.com/">http://api.google.com/</A> and create an account. You will then receive
+  your Google API key by email. Start pinot and enter the key in the corresponding
+  field in the General tab of the Preferences box.
+
+
+4. Automatic indexing and monitoring
+
+
+  Pinot can automatically index :
+    * directories and their contents. Monitoring for changes is optional.
+    * mbox mail accounts. Monitoring is always enabled.
+  The former is configured with the My Documents tab in the Preferences box; the latter
+  with the My EMail tab.
+  Both are handled by the D-Bus service.
+
+
+5. Search strategy
+
+
+  When querying an index, Pinot adopts a multi-stepped search strategy that
+  first attempts to find the documents that best match the query. If a given
+  step doesn't return results, the next step alters the query slightly before
+  it is run again. These steps are :
+    * step 1
+      obey the query's operators, don't stem terms
+    * step 2
+      obey operators, stem terms
+    * step 3
+      don't follow operators (all terms are OR'ed) and don't stem terms
+    * step 4
+      don't follow operators and stem terms
+  Stemming is available only to Stored Queries for which a language is defined
+  (Query parameters box, Indexes only tab).
+
+
+6. Viewing cached results
+
+
+  Results returned by search engines can be viewed &quot;live&quot; by selecting the View
+  menuitem under Results. This opens whatever application defined for the
+  result's MIME type and/or protocol scheme.
+  In addition, Pinot allows to view the page as cached by Google and the Wayback
+  Machine. Cache providers are actually configured in globalconfig.xml, located
+  in $PREFIX/share/pinot/. For instance :
+  &lt;cache&gt;
+    &lt;name&gt;Google&lt;/name&gt;
+    &lt;location&gt;<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:%url0&lt;/location">http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:%url0&lt;/location</A>&gt;
+    &lt;protocols&gt;http, https&lt;/protocols&gt;
+  &lt;/cache&gt;
+  This is self-explanatory :-) Here it configures a cache provider called
+  &quot;Google&quot; that handles both http and https. The location field supports
+  two parameters that are substituted to obtain the URL to open : 
+    * %url is the result's URL as displayed by the UI, eg
+      <A HREF="http://pinot.berlios.de/download.html">http://pinot.berlios.de/download.html</A>
+    * %url0 is the result's URL without the protocol, eg
+      pinot.berlios.de/download.html
+
+
+7. Installing additional search plugins
+
+
+  Starting with v0.42, Pinot supports both Sherlock and OpenSearch Description
+  plugins. They are installed in $PREFIX/share/pinot/engines/, where PREFIX
+  is usually /usr.
+  Additional engines can be installed in that directory or in ~/.pinot/engines.
+  Note this directory is not created automatically.
+  Sherlock is what Firefox and the Mozilla suite use. Chances are that somebody
+  wrote a plugin for the engine you are interested in. MyCroft at
+  <A HREF="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/">http://mycroft.mozdev.org/</A> has got plenty of plugins. Beware that a lot are
+  out of date and will require some changes. Use pinot-search on the
+  command-line to run a quick check on a plugin, e.g. :
+  $ pinot-search sherlock /usr/share/pinot/engines/Bozo.src &quot;clowns&quot; 10
+
+  Plugins are categorized by channels. For Sherlock plugins, the routeType
+  element under SEARCH specifies the name of the channel the plugin belongs to.
+  As for OpenSearch, A9.com has an extensive list at
+  <A HREF="http://a9.com/-/search/moreColumns.jsp.">http://a9.com/-/search/moreColumns.jsp.</A> A Description file is not available
+  for all engines though...
+  Pinot should work with OpenSearch Description 1.0 and 1.1 (draft 2) plugins.
+  One thing to keep in mind is that because Description doesn't describe how
+  to parse the results page returned by the search engine, Pinot assumes that
+  the engine will return results formatted according to the OpenSearch Response
+  standard.
+  In practice, this means that plugins that don't stick to the following rules
+  will be ignored or won't show any result :
+    * For Description 1.1 plugins, the type attribute on the Url field must be
+      set to &quot;application/atom+xml&quot; or &quot;application/rss+xml&quot; (default).
+      &quot;text/html&quot; will be rejected.
+    * The search engine's results page content type must be some form of XML,
+      otherwise Pinot won't attempt parsing it. 
+  Pinot differs from the Description spec in that it interprets the Tags field
+  as a channel name. The standard defines Tags as a &quot;space-delimited set of
+  words that are used as keywords to identify and categorize this search
+  content&quot;.
+
+8. File formats
+
+
+  Supported document types are
+  * plain text
+  * HTML
+  * PDF (pdftotext is required)
+  * RTF (unrtf is required)
+  * MS Word (antiword is required)
+  * XML
+  * OpenDocument/StarOffice files
+  * mbox
+  * MP3 and Ogg Vorbis (TagLib required)
+  More formats will be supported as the project matures.
+
+
+9. More Like This
+
+
+   The More Like This feature is enabled when at least one of the results
+   currently selected is indexed, ie if the result was previously manually
+   indexed in &quot;My Web Pages&quot;, or if it's a local file indexed in &quot;My Documents&quot;.
+   Its role is to expand queries.
+   When activated, it will suggest other terms from the selected results
+   and create a new Stored Query prefixed with &quot;More Like&quot;. For instance,
+   if you run a Stored Query with name &quot;Me&quot;, the expanded query's name will be
+   &quot;More Like Me&quot;.
+
+
+10. Starting the D-Bus service
+
+
+   Thanks to D-Bus activation, the service is started whenever one of its
+   methods are invoked, either by the UI or any other consumer application.
+   When directories or mbox files are configured for indexing in the UI,
+   clicking OK on the Preferences box will call a method of the service
+   to make sure it is running.   
+   If you want the service to be started when you start a new X session,
+   add pinot-dbus-daemon to your desktop environment's startup programs
+   list.

+- At startup, when listing an index or indexing documents, Pinot complains

   This is likely because a previous instance didn't exit properly and one

 - If you have built Pinot from source, make sure you have done a &quot;make install&quot;.
   Pinot will fail to start if it can't find stuff it needs, its icon for instance.
