    Thanks to D-Bus activation, the service is started whenever one of its

+
    If you want the service to be started when you start a new X session,
    add pinot-dbus-daemon to your desktop environment's startup programs
    list.
+   A few things to keep in mind :
+     * the service doesn't reload its configuration while running, so any
+       change (adding or removing a directory or mbox file) will take effect
+       when the service is restarted.
+     * when starting, the service will first crawl all configured locations
+       and (re)index new and modified files. This might be CPU intensive,
+       but not so much that it prevents you from doing anything else.
+     * when finished crawling, the service will monitor these locations
+       for changes and should consume little resources, unless a huge
+       quantity of files needs its attention.
 
+  For a list of available D-Bus methods, see the file pinot-dbus-daemon.xml.
